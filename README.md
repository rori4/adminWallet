# flashbots bundler app

* web app; basically etherscan but with multiple transactions and flashbots integration
* enter contract address and get buttons that allow you to send transactions or add them to an orderd list
* transactions in the list can then be sent as a flashbots bundle or a normal (mempool) nonce-sequenced array of transactions
